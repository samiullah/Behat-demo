  Scenario Outline: As an anonymous user I should be able to perform basic keyword search
    Given I am on "<url>"
    Then I should see "<search_text>"
    And I fill in "<search_field>" with "<search_term>"

      | /es | Buscar      | Buscar por palabra clave, ingrediente, plato | Buscar por          | rasmalai OR pizza |

  #  Use upper-case AND to require all words, but this is the same as the default behavior. Example:
  #  cat AND dog (same as cat dog, content must contain both "cat" and "dog").

      | /es | Buscar      | Buscar por palabra clave, ingrediente, plato | Buscar por          | chocolate AND brownies |

#  You can precede keywords by - to exclude them; you must still
#  have at least one "positive" keyword.
#  Example: cat -dog (content must contain cat and cannot contain dog).
